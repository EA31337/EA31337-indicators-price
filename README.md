## Price indicators

Price indicators in Forex are a specific category of technical indicators that
generate a single price value as their output. These indicators focus on
analyzing and representing specific aspects of price data to provide insights
into market trends, momentum, or other relevant information.

These price indicators are commonly used to identify trends, support and
resistance levels, and potential entry or exit points in the market. By
focusing on the single price value generated by these indicators, traders can
gain insights into the overall price direction based on the average price over
a specific period and make informed trading decisions.
